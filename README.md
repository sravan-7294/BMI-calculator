# BMI-calculator
A BMI calculator is a tool that calculates Body Mass Index based on a user's height and weight. It categorizes the result into groups like underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Users input their name, height, and weight, and the calculator displays their BMI value and corresponding health category.
